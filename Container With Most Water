Container With Most Water

Problem Statement: You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). 
                    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

                    Notice that you may not slant the container.
                    
Solution: 
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        maxi = 0
        while left < right:
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            maxi = max(maxi, area)
            if (height[left] < height[right]):
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return maxi
