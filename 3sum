#My solution passed 308/311 test cases, but exceeded the time limit when it got to 308. I utilized the itertools module and the combinations function to 
  \generate the list of 3 numbers and ran tests to filter them out according to the problem specifics. 

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        import itertools
        x = itertools.combinations(nums, 3)
        y = [sorted(i) for i in x if (sum(i) == 0)]
        z = []
        [z.append(i) for i in y if i not in z]
        return z
        
        
#If you have any ideas about how to make it more efficient, I will be glad to listen to your ideas.
